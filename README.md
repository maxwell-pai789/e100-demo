# Demonstration Repository for PAI 789

### Summary

This set of files is a demonstration repository for Advanced Policy
Analysis. It has this readme file written in Markdown, a very simple
Python script `wordcount.py` that reports the frequency of words in
a sample of text, and a file called `sample.txt` containing the text
to be counted.
